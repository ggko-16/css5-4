                <p>
                    Nestled at the foot of Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, this hostel has a rich history tied to mountaineering 
                    and the great outdoors. Originally built as a coach inn in the late 1800s, it served travelers journeying through the rugged 
                    terrain of Snowdonia. What makes Pen-y-Pass special is its role in outdoor culture. Over the decades, it became a base for 
                    legendary climbers who tackled the Snowdon Horseshoe—a challenging circuit of ridges—and contributed to the development of 
                    modern mountaineering in the UK.

                    Located in a beautifully preserved Victorian mansion built in 1885, the HI Sacramento Hostel offers a glimpse into the 
                    grandeur of California's past. Originally the home of a wealthy gold prospector, the mansion later became a boarding house
                     and eventually a hostel. Its elegant architecture, complete with stained glass windows, carved wooden staircases, and 
                     period furnishings, makes it a unique blend of history and hospitality.
